# Spatial Analysis in R

This repository is intended to hold my analysis for my response to Ari Lamstein's 
R Shapefile [contest](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2016/07/12/announcing-r-shapefile-contest/). 

My Analysis consists of my efforts to answer the following questions:

  1. What is the effect of an airport on a county's unemployment rate?
  2. What is the effect of distance to one of the Top 50 airports in the country as measured on the airport's: 
    a. Passenger Movement
    b. Cargo Movement
    c. Total Movement.
